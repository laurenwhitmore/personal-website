      <p>Welcome to my webstie! I am a third-year Software Engineering student at Western Univeristy. Over the past three years we have explored many aspects of the Software Development lifecycle and Software Development tools. I have taken particular interest in full-stack development, with most experience doing this with a MERN tool stack! 
        </p>
       <p> Apart from coding, I have always had a passion for sports, including skiing, running and triathlon. As well, I am super interested in reading (my goal is 52 books in 2023), some of my favorite genres are Romance and Fantasy books!
        </p>
